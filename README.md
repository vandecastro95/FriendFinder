# FriendFinder

  Friend Finder is a full stack node app deployed on Heroku. Data is saved on a file, not on a database. It uses Express to configure and operate the server. Routes are setup to complete the survey, view the API, and post data. A default route also brings users to the homepage, regardless of the path the user attempts to access.

# How to use
  Friend Finder implements friend matching based on the userâ€™s responses to a ten-question survey, User input is then saved on a file to be compared to future users.
